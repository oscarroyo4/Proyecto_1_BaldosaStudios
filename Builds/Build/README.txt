FATAL FURY PROTOTYPE by Baldosa Studios.

This is the 0.5 build in our Fatal Fury project.
In this build we can see 3 screens, starting by the welcome screen, then a character selection sreen (only Terry Bogard is avariable), and then the Pao Pao cafe Stage.
Pao Pao Cafe Stage: Terry vs Terry. Both are playable and they can move forward and backward, jump, punch, kick, and do the special attack.
